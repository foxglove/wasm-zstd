# @foxglove/wasm-zstd

https://github.com/facebook/zstd compiled to WebAssembly. For now only decompression is supported. PRs welcome!

## API

`@foxglove/wasm-zstd` exports a single function:

```js
export default (buffer: Buffer, destinationByteSize: number) => Buffer;
```

Here is an example of using the module:

```js
import fs from "fs";
import decompress from "@foxglove/wasm-zstd";

const compressedBytes = fs.readFileSync("compressed.zstd");

// Currently you need to know the size of the output buffer so the wasm runtime
// can allocate enough bytes to decompress into
const outputBytes = compressedBytes * 10;
const decompressedBytes = decompress(compressedBytes, outputBytes);
```

## Using the module in a browser

Emscripten compiled WebAssembly modules are built in 2 parts: a `.js` side and a `.wasm` side. In the browser the `.js` side needs to download the `.wasm` side from the server so it can compile it. There is [more information available in the emscripten documentation](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/compiling/Deploying-Pages.html).

## Asynchronous loading & compiling

After the `.wasm` binary is loaded (via `fetch` in the browser or `require` in node) it must be compiled by the WebAssembly runtime. If you call `decompress` before it is finished compiling it will throw an error indicating it isn't ready yet. To wait for the module to be loaded you can do something like the following:

```
import decompress from "@foxglove/wasm-zstd";

async function doWork() {
  await decompress.isLoaded;
  decompress(buffer, outputByteLength);
}
```

## Developing locally

1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `yarn build` to invoke emcc inside a Docker container and compile the code in `wasm-zstd.c` as well as the required zstd source files. The output will be in `dist/` on the host machine.
3. Run `yarn test` to run the tests.

## Releasing

1. Run `yarn version --[major|minor|patch]` to bump version
2. Run `git push && git push --tags` to push new tag
3. GitHub Actions will take care of the rest
